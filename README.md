# Zillow-Project
Python and Machine Learning Course
Goal was to collect data on many houses in a certain area, then convert this data to a format that can be read
and analyzed by different machine learning algorithms to predict future house prices.

There are two files: EE890Scrapper.py and CreateCSVFile.py.

EE890Scrapper.py
Run the program and copy and paste a internet address that links to a specific house on zillow.  The program will
download and output all relevant information to the text file relating to address, price, etc.
Files will output to location of EE890Scrapper location.  Type "quit" to stop.

CreateCSVFile.py
After collecting data on multiple houses using the EE890Scrapper.py, update the file path to where all the text files are
stored and run this code.  It will convert all the information into a excel spread sheet which was used to perform linear
regression, lasso regression, and a few other forms of regression to predict housing prices.
